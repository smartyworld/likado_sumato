# start by fetching a raspian image file, whihc might be zipped
# this link is handy
# https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/linux.md
# on this machine I cd to ~/makesdcards/

wget http://howtoraspberrypi.com/download/raspbian_latest.zip

# and unzip it

unzip -p 2020-04-10-raspian_buster.zip

# then  insert your sd card into your machine or your card into your carad reader
# then list all the devices

sudo ls -ltr /dev/*

# or an alternative, around moving the card in and out of the slot to determine wih one is the card...

lsblk -p

# unmount any partitions that are on the card eg card /dev/mmcblk0 might have a partition /dev/mmcblk0p1... or /dev/sdb might have /dev/sdb1

umount /dev/mmcblk0p1

# finally use the dd tool to copy the img file to the sd card. note params bs = block size, if = image file, of = output file

sudo dd bs=4M if=~/makesdcards/2020-04-18-raspian-buster.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 status=progress conv=fsync

#  if this fails you can make the block size smaller eg 1M
